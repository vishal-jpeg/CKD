New-MgBetaEntitlementManagementAccessPackageResourceRequest → New-MgEntitlementManagementResourceRequest
While the beta cmdlet specifically targets access package resource requests, the production cmdlet serves a similar purpose by handling resource requests within entitlement management.

To transition from beta to production cmdlets, ensure you have the latest version of the Microsoft.Graph.Identity.Governance module installed. You can do this by running:

Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph.Identity.Governance -Scope CurrentUser -Force
68

This will allow you to utilize the stable, production-ready cmdlets for managing entitlement management tasks.

If you need assistance updating your scripts to use these production cmdlets or have further questions, feel free to ask!
