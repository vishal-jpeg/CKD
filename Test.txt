AD User Creation via Azure DevOps Pipeline

📘 Purpose

This document outlines the step-by-step process for creating a new Azure AD user by triggering a dedicated Azure DevOps pipeline. This pipeline automates the user creation process in the Azure AD tenant using PowerShell and appropriate service principal permissions.

✅ Prerequisites

- You must have access to the Azure DevOps portal.

- The pipeline can only be run from the main branch.

- Pipeline execution requires approval from either:

  - Dan

  - Nelson

🔐 Permissions

The underlying Azure service principal used in the pipeline has been granted the User Administrator role in Azure Active Directory. This is sufficient to create users via PowerShell using the New-AzADUser cmdlet.



ℹ️ There is no need for Graph API permissions such as User.ReadWrite.All as long as PowerShell cmdlets are used.
